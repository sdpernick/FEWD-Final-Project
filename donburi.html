    <div class="review donburi">
    <p class="space">Donburi is a fast causal concept that allows diners to order at the counter and then sit at a narrow, minimalist bar.  There are hooks lining the wall for belongings.</br></p>  

    <p class="space">I rarely repeat dining experiences in DC because of the growing variety of options, but Donburi is an exception.  The word Donburi describes a Japanese rice bowl that contains meat, fish, veggies or any combination of the three.  They offer many of these combinations, including sushi grade fish and grilled eel that taste as divine as it smells. For those who don't want to pick, try the Moriwase, a combination of fresh tuna, salmon, fried chicken, grilled eel, pickled veggies, rice and a delightful teriyaki-like sauce.</br></p> 

    <p class="space">Staff are all young, good-looking and enthusiastic about their food.  Some of the chefs' work happens behind the bar, so there is a consistent barrage of smells and a good old-fashioned cooking show.  It's a perfect place to have an uninterrupted dining experience because the bar is lined with condiments, utensils, chopsticks, napkins and pitchers of water.  No wait staff required.</br></p>

    <p class="space">Located in the heart of Adams Morgan on 18th street, it's a great place to grab a quick meal before hitting one of the many bars that line the strip, including Madam's Organ, Roofer's Union and Bourbon.</br>
