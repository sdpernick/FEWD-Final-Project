    <div class="review toki">
       <p class="space">Toki Underground is one of those restaurants that, upon opening, received a ton of hype.  It continues to do so today.  With hype, however, comes wait times.  On weekends, they are daunting. To that end, the friendly staff sends a text when the 'table' is ready.  I say 'table' because the space is one long, winding series of bar stools.  This place is best for solo or two diners.  There's no space in the tiny upstairs dining area to wait, but there is a bar downstairs and several bars around the area, including Granville Moore's and Smith Commons.</br></p>   

      <p class="space">
       So let's talk about why, amidst long wait times and limited seating, this place is worth it.  Toki Underground specializes in ramen.  Everyone is wild for the kimchi ramen.  I have a complicated relationship with kimchi.  And by complicated I mean I simply don't like it.  But there are many options for all pallets.  The Toki Classic, Red Miso and Taipei Curry Chicken are not to be missed.  The curry chicken in particular, elicited a 'Oh my gosh' response any time my dining companions took a bite of the flavorful, salty, sweet, umami chicken.  

       <p class="space">If you're in the mood for something besides ramen, they also offer dumplings and side dishes that include the adventurous 'stinky tofu' and the guaranteed to be delicious fried chicken steamed buns.</br>
