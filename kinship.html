           When a friend suggested we check out Kinship, the new Eric Ziebold venture, in the rapidly growing Convention Center area, I looked at menu with great anticipation.  This is a chef who worked for ten years at the three Michelin star restaurant, French Laundry.  The man presumably knows his way around cuisine.  Upon review of the menu, I couldn't help but to roll my eyes.  The menu is divided into categories such as 'craft', 'history' and 'indulgence'.</br></p> 

          <p class="space">Don't judge a book by its' pretentious cover.  The meal was nothing short of phenomenal, the service attentive yet not obsequious, the atmosphere charming.</br></p>  

          <p class="space">My dining companion and I embraced the 'medium plates' style as if they were 'small plates' and ordered four dishes: Maine Lobster toast, sweetbreads, sunchokes and truffle pasta.</br></p>    

          <p class="space">Although the menu is forever evolving, the lobster toast is a staple and must-try (except for our vegan/vegetarian friends).  Its' melt-in-your-mouth creaminess combined with the salty seafood taste is nirvana in each bite.  I found myself wishing we had ordered two.  I'm not really a sweetbread person, but their preparation made them more palatable.  My friend, an avid consumer of sweetbreads, couldn't stop raving.   The sunchokes were covered in a vivid maroon sauce and were prepared the way vegetables should be prepared-unrecognizable as healthy.  And finally, the truffle pasta.  A waiter placed dish of pasta and white sauce on our table and another waiter materialized out of nowhere with a grater.  In his hand, however, was not a block of parmesan, but rather a large black truffle.  He shaved and shaved, a most generous portion.</br></p> 

          <p class="space">Completely satisfied, we were ready to call it a night.  But then, the chocolate chip souffle was calling our name.  Priced at a hefty $22, we weren't sure about our choice, until it arrived at the table.  Imagine a soft, warm bed of chocolate chip cake with a crunchy crust and light, sweet whipped cream.  That's exactly what we experienced as we wolfed it down.</br></p> 

          <p class="space">Overall, wonderful spot not to be missed.  But, it is quite pricey.  It's also a small restaurant so best for groups of no more than six, ideal for 2-4.  Grab friends who are enthusiastic about fancy ingredients, family who is picking up the check or a special occasion with a significant other.</br></p>
