       <p class="space">In 2013, when The Red Hen opened in Bloomingdale, the small, gentrifying neighborhood just east of Shaw, it was greeted with little fanfare.  That quickly changed, however, as critics and customers alike gushed with unequivocal praise.</br></p>

        <p class="space">Let's talk about the restaurant's physical plant.  It is simply adorable, taking residence on a relatively quiet street.  Although the neighborhood is growing, it still feels like a getaway from the hustle of DC.  With its' exposed brick walls and light wood furniture, the interior is warm, inviting and cozy.</br></p>  

        <p class="space">The menu is constantly evolving based on the season, but there are a few staples, including the Mezze Rigatoni with Fennel Sausage Ragu + Pecorino Romano.  A simple dish with complex flavors.  Talk about comfort food.  Also to try: Whipped Ricotta Crostini with Balsamic Brown Butter + Truffle Honey and the perfectly cooked Roasted Half Chicken with Polenta, Bacon and Frisee.  I dare you to say that sentence three times in a row without salivating.</br></p>

        <p class="space">Reservations are definitely recommended.  Take a group of friends or a hot date for a lovely evening of comforting Italian fare.  Oh, and try the orange wine!  It's very dry and pairs well with everything. And just imagine the dinner conversation.  Suddenly you are the 'knowledgeable about wine' person.  Just remember: wine comes in red, white, pink and now, orange.</br></p> 
         
        <p class="space">"Oh, have you heard about this 'orange wine'? Supposed to be excellent."</br>
